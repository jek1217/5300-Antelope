# 5300-Antelope


Sprint Verano: Vishakha Bhavsar and Virmel Gacad

Milestone 1: Skeleton

  -Sets up Berkeley DB environment
  -Uses SQLParserResult
  -sql5300 is the main driver program, being the default makefile target
  
  
  
Milestone 2: Rudimentary Storage Engine


  We have gotten mixed results with output/testing in regards to Milestone 2. Virmel has gotten the program to compile but
  reaches a library shared error when trying to run it. Vishakha has gotten to compile the program, run the program, and
  complete the test_heap_storage() test function. We have done all our work solely on CS1, so we do not know if our program works
  outside of CS1 as well.
  
  
  Our files include:
  
  -storage_engine.h, which was given to us
  -heap_storage.h
  -heap_storage.cpp
  -sql5300.cpp
  -Makefile
  
  
  Quirks:
  
  -Memory management could be looked into. 
  -Random quick-thought comments could be found throughout.
